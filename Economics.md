# Science and quick intro

### The start of this will serve to inform the reader of a few key things that must be understood to understand the rest of the reading

When debating, people tend to take a very offensive stance. This doesn't hold true for many people, but consider two examples. 
There are two ways of presenting a belief. One is to renounce belief in a theory, hypothesis, etc., and the other is to announce one's beliefs.
Consider:
"I believe the Earth is flat" is an example of an announcement of one's belief. This informs the other person that you do not believe in a traditional idea, 
and that you believe that the Earth is flat. 
"I don't believe in atoms" is an example of the renouncement of quantum theory. This example's key difference is that it does not inform the other person of
what you believe. It simply says what you do not believe.

Why is this important?

Many people take on aggressive dispositions, especially in matters of religion, politics, economics, etc. What would be the first thing you would ask someone
who stated that they do not believe in atoms? Some might ask why, but still others may ask what you do believe. This perceptibly innocent question has a dark
background. Many, especially those who are not strong in their current beliefs only know how to argue/debate in a puerile manner: attacking the opponent. 
By telling the other person *what* you believe, you are giving them leverage as they will focus all the attention of the debate on proving you wrong instead 
of taking time to consider your points genuinely. So, let's consider the other example. "I believe the Earth is flat". This example immediately gives the other
person in the debate ammunition to use against you. They will immediately question your intelligence or berate you with endless or even meaningless questions. 

This *aversion* towards anything differing from what might be considered the norm drives hatred towards other people and innovation. A burning topic that is 
included in this is AI. A horrific number of false claims regarding AI are made on a potentially hourly basis. People hate being wrong, but being wrong is
the most important part of us as humans. Real science is done to question whether something is right. Hypotheses aren't tested by showing that a hypothesis is correct.
Rather, they are tested to see if they are wrong. Anyone who tries to prove a hypothesis right has already made a critical error as many statements
can be proven correct through dubious methods or subterfuge. 

It is inherently infantile to loathe being incorrect. Consider the Italian polymath, Galileo. He set out to prove many previously assumed truths incorrect. 
He, as many today, was persecuted harshly for this reason. Through persecution, you propagate and perpetuate the opposing belief. This can be seen in early 1st
century along with the 2nd century in the martyrdom of christian persons. The murder and torture of these people only served to prove that they were in fact right
in the eyes of many. One who is known to be wrong is not a threat to the status quo, and it is therefore unnecessary to attack them over their beliefs. 

# Controversy

There are many "taboo" or otherwise controversial topics that are debated frequently and with great temper. Let's observe both sides and try to remove as much bias
as possible. It is *highly* important to note that I, being a human, am inherently biased, so please do research on your own when the time is sufficient.

### Economic policies

A large number of Americans have a strong sense of execration for the wealthy and "well-to-do". In a capitalistic society, such is to be expected as human jealousy
and a sense of self-righteousness can sometimes cloud objectivism and force these people to turn to subjectivism. 

**It is not possible for a single class to exist in any economic model.**

Consider communism. Communism is an idea of a "shared wealth" where private rights are mostly stripped away and all the power is given to the government to control the
economy and people. Under absolute good will, this system is logical; however, in practice, it is a very ignorant policy as not all people do all actions with selfless
intent. You create two classes. There is the government (upper) class and the citizen (lower) class. Control in the power of few has shown devastating consequences. A
few examples include Rehoboam circa 1,000 BC, in which he made a poor economic decision that resulted in eventual civil war, another includes many of the heinous acts
performed by the RCC under the Pope's rule, another more modern one would be the dictatorship rule of Kim Jong Un and Adolf Hitler. These two political figures caused
great harm to their country due to poor decision making. 

Next, consider socialism. Socialism is like a beautiful book written in poor English. The idea is purely utopian; however, the aforementioned corruption and selfish
nature of many humans of this age prevents such an occurence. Aside from corruption, these principles do not foster innovation as there is no real reward for excellence
in a true socialistic society. Positive reinforcement is a very basic and well understood concept that serves to further this point. By removing the reward for work, 
work will not be done. Additionally, the same binary class structure of government and citizens is created.

Finally, capitalism is world renowned for its extreme success. The United States is the star of the capitalistic show, accounting for the wealth of ~20% of the world. 
Capitalism splits society into 3 (or 5) classes: low, middle, and high. Ideally, capitalism involves 0 government involvement in the economy. Tariffs, taxes, certain
limitations in markets, monopolization prohibitions, etc. The idea of very few people controlling the wealth of the nation as a result of capitalism is a major turn off
for many; however, in a true capitalistic society, all this money is funneled back into the economy in the form of wealth, job opportunities, and many other things.
So, what hurts capitalism? There are three major flaws with America's capitalistic economy. The first is government involvement. The second is the Fed's control over
the money supply. Generally, this isn't too problematic, but the forced creation of inflation to help the lower class makes long term investments lose a lot of value. 
The final one is improper usage of money. Storing legal tender and not investing it-allowing the cash to stay stagnant-fails to introduce earned money back into the 
economy, and that money is therefore entirely subject to inflationary value changes. 

#### Key takeaway:

There is no perfect economic model. Some are objectively bad such as communism, but due to the imperfect and selfish nature of humans, no singular economic model is
able to realistically sustain a country perfectly while offering the best outcome for its citizens. 

### Final words

This is a lot of reading for some, but I hope that, by reading this, you were able to open your mind a little bit more.

If it wasn't obvious, I am a proponent for capitalism as this method of economic governance has led to the most good compared to all others.
