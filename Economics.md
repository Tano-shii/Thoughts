# Science and quick intro

### The start of this will serve to inform the reader of a few key things that must be understood to understand the rest of the reading

When debating, people tend to take a very offensive stance. This doesn't hold true for many people, but consider two examples. 
There are two ways of presenting a belief. One is to renounce belief in a theory, hypothesis, etc., and the other is to announce one's beliefs.
Consider:
"I believe the Earth is flat" is an example of an announcement of one's belief. This informs the other person that you do not believe in a traditional idea, 
and that you believe that the Earth is flat. 
"I don't believe in atoms" is an example of the renouncement of quantum theory. This example's key difference is that it does not inform the other person of
what you believe. It simply says what you do not believe.

Why is this important?

Many people take on aggressive dispositions, especially in matters of religion, politics, economics, etc. What would be the first thing you would ask someone
who stated that they do not believe in atoms? Some might ask why, but still others may ask what you do believe. This perceptibly innocent question has a dark
background. Many, especially those who are not strong in their current beliefs only know how to argue/debate in a puerile manner: attacking the opponent. 
By telling the other person *what* you believe, you are giving them leverage as they will focus all the attention of the debate on proving you wrong instead 
of taking time to consider your points genuinely. So, let's consider the other example. "I believe the Earth is flat". This example immediately gives the other
person in the debate ammunition to use against you. They will immediately question your intelligence or berate you with endless or even meaningless questions. 

This *aversion* towards anything differing from what might be considered the norm drives hatred towards other people and innovation. A burning topic that is 
included in this is AI. A horrific number of false claims regarding AI are made on a potentially hourly basis. People hate being wrong, but being wrong is
the most important part of us as humans. Real science is done to question whether something is right. Hypotheses aren't tested by showing that a hypothesis is correct.
Rather, they are tested to see if they are wrong. Anyone who tries to prove a hypothesis right has already made a critical error as many statements
can be proven correct through dubious methods or subterfuge. 

It is inherently infantile to loathe being incorrect. Consider the Italian polymath, Galileo. He set out to prove many previously assumed truths incorrect. 
He, as many today, was persecuted harshly for this reason. Through persecution, you propagate and perpetuate the opposing belief. This can be seen in early 1st
century along with the 2nd century in the martyrdom of christian persons. The murder and torture of these people only served to prove that they were in fact right
in the eyes of many. One who is known to be wrong is not a threat to the status quo, and it is therefore unnecessary to attack them over their beliefs.
